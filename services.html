                            <p> 
                                Anxiety is a disorder that can affect everything you do in your daily life. 
                                It is not something you can quickly recover from, like a cold or stomach bug. 
                                Many people with anxiety think they are just feeling sad, and that it will go away with time. 
                                For some people, it does just that. But for 15 million others, anxiety is a constant feeling that does not go away 
                                on its own. These people are the ones who may benefit from extra support and help. 
                                In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) found that anxiety is the second greatest reason for disability in the world. 
                                Unfortunately, only 10% of these people ever receive any effective treatment.

                            <p> What we are doing is that we are providing a space where people 
                                can openly talk to people about what is going on and no one will judge them. 
                                It is hard for people who are depressed to get the curage to talk but by having 
                                them talk to strangers it allows them to 
                                open up with out them worring about if they will be laughed at by people they know.
